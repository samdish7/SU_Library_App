### Overview 

Our team updated the Android app for the Guerrieri Academic Commons at Salisbury University. Our client, Chris Woodall, developed the iOS version of the app, and offered our Software Engineering class an opportunity to fix and redesign the Android version, which hadn't been updated since 2017. We needed to first fix the current app because there were several applications that caused the app to crash, most of the information was out of date, and some of the social media accounts displayed were no longer used.  Once that was done, we were tasked with redesigning the app and making it more efficent and easier for our client to use. I have all three versions of the app above, Version 1.0 being the original, Version 1.1 being the "fixed" app, and Version 2.0.2 being the final version uploaded to Play Store

## Breakdown

### Spring 2020

As stated before, Version 1.0 had many flaws including but not limited to:

- Outdated information
- Numerous crashes
- Outdated social media
- Features that did crash the app, but didn't work properly

Therefore, our team took the first semester to fix the current crashes of the app, update the information, and learn the file structure and how to use android studio.  I personally have not had any experience with it, so it was a pretty big learning curve for the first month or so. 

### Fall 2020
