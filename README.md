### Overview 

Our team updated the Android app for the Guerrieri Academic Commons at Salisbury University. Our client, Chris Woodall, developed the iOS version of the app, and offered our Software Engineering class an opportunity to fix and redesign the Android version, which hadn't been updated since 2017. We needed to first fix the current app because there were several applications that caused the app to crash, most of the information was out of date, and some of the social media accounts displayed were no longer used.  Once that was done, we were tasked with redesigning the app and making it more efficent and easier for our client to use.
